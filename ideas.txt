use a CNN,
really needs action masking - the tweak I gave about randomizing isn't good (in step, basic env)
and maybe some intermediate rewarding for faster convergence? (when booping others, forming trios)


Approach	Reward?	Action Taken?	Recommended?
Penalize with -1 and end	-1	None	❌ Harsh, slows training
Retry until legal	0	Legal fallback	✅ Best for SB3 now
Action masking	—	Mask space	✅✅ Advanced but best
