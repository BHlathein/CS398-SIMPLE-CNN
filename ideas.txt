Action masking	—	Mask space	✅✅ Advanced but best


Great question — this is a classic challenge when designing reinforcement learning environments for board games. Board games often have **sparse, high-dimensional, and heavily constrained state and action spaces**. Here's how to handle that thoughtfully:

---

### 1. **Designing the State Space**

**Avoid raw representations** if they’re sparse or inefficient. Instead, use a **compact and structured representation**:
- Use `np.array` with shape like `(rows, cols, channels)` where each channel encodes something (e.g., own pieces, opponent pieces, valid placement).
- For games like Boop, Connect4, Chess:
  - 1st channel: current player’s pieces
  - 2nd channel: opponent’s pieces
  - 3rd channel: any special markers (e.g., power-ups, goals, valid moves if needed)
- Normalize data if needed (e.g., use `0.0` and `1.0`, or integers for categories).

> Avoid using raw strings or complex objects in the observation — flatten or encode them.

---

### 2. **Dealing with Invalid Actions**

This is key. RL struggles when agents can frequently choose invalid actions, especially in discrete action spaces. You have two main strategies:

#### A. **Mask Invalid Actions**
- Provide a **mask** (e.g., a `np.array` of booleans) indicating which actions are legal.
- Some libraries (e.g., SB3 with `ActionMasker` or custom wrappers) support this.
- In your `step()` function:
  - If an invalid action is chosen, return a penalty and `terminated = True`, or
  - Replace it with a random valid action (less ideal during training, OK for robustness testing).

#### B. **Reduce the Action Space**
- Instead of one large fixed discrete space (like 6x6x5 = 180 actions), **encode only the legal moves as indices**, then:
  - Keep a mapping: `legal_actions = [actual_action_1, actual_action_2, ...]`
  - The agent chooses an index `i`, and you map it back: `action = legal_actions[i]`
- This requires custom wrappers to train properly, but improves sample efficiency.

---

### 3. **Structured Action Representations**

Instead of a single `Discrete(n)` space, consider using a **`MultiDiscrete`** or **`Dict` space**:
```python
spaces.Dict({
    "action_type": spaces.Discrete(2),      # place, move, etc.
    "row": spaces.Discrete(6),
    "col": spaces.Discrete(6),
    "piece_type": spaces.Discrete(5),
})
```
This allows the policy to learn structure in actions (e.g., placing pieces vs moving them). But still, you need to **validate actions** and mask or penalize as needed.

---

### 4. **Sparse Reward Problem**

In board games, rewards often come only at the end. To improve learning:
- Use **reward shaping**: e.g., give intermediate rewards for capturing, progressing, controlling the board.
- Use **self-play**: helps agents learn progressively by facing increasingly stronger versions of themselves.
- Use **curriculum learning**: start with simpler subgames (e.g., smaller boards or fewer pieces).

---

### TL;DR
| Problem                  | Solution |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Sparse state             | Use compact `(board, stock, player)` representations |
| Invalid actions          | Mask them or reduce action space dynamically |
| Large discrete space     | Use structured actions via `MultiDiscrete` or `Dict` |
| Sparse reward            | Use reward shaping, self-play, or curriculum learning |

---

If you're using `Stable-Baselines3`, I can help you write a wrapper that handles action masking or dynamic legal actions too. Want to go in that direction?

Perfect — let’s walk through how to set up **action masking** for a board game with a discrete action space using **Stable-Baselines3**. This will help the agent **only select legal actions**, and you'll still keep action validation in the `step()` function.

---

### Step 1: Define a Custom Wrapper with Action Mask

First, make sure your environment exposes a `legal_actions()` method that returns a list of valid discrete action indices.

Here’s a custom wrapper class:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np
from gymnasium import spaces

class ActionMaskWrapper(gym.ObservationWrapper):
    def __init__(self, env):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.observation_space = spaces.Dict({
            "observation": env.observation_space,
            "action_mask": spaces.Box(low=0, high=1, shape=(self.action_space.n,), dtype=np.uint8)
        })

    def observation(self, obs):
        mask = np.zeros(self.action_space.n, dtype=np.uint8)
        for action in self.env.legal_actions():
            mask[action] = 1
        return {
            "observation": obs,
            "action_mask": mask
        }
```

This will modify your observation to look like:
```python
{
    "observation": ...,    # your normal board state
    "action_mask": [...]   # a 0/1 array showing valid actions
}
```

---

### Step 2: Custom Policy to Respect Mask (With SB3)

Stable-Baselines3 **doesn’t support action masks out of the box**, but the [**SB3-Contrib**](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib) library does!

Install it:
```bash
pip install stable-baselines3[extra] sb3-contrib
```

Then use the `MaskedActorCriticPolicy` with `PPO`:

```python
from sb3_contrib.ppo_mask import MaskablePPO
from sb3_contrib.common.maskable.utils import get_action_masks

model = MaskablePPO("MultiInputPolicy", wrapped_env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=100_000)
```

> Make sure the policy is `"MultiInputPolicy"` since your observations are now a dictionary.

---

### Step 3: Modify Your Environment’s `step()`

Still include the `is_legal(action)` check inside `step()` for safety:
```python
def step(self, action):
    if not self.is_legal(action):
        # Either auto-correct, skip, or penalize
        reward = -1
        terminated = True
        return self.get_observation(), reward, terminated, False, {"reason": "illegal_action"}
    ...
```

---

### Summary

| Part                     | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `ActionMaskWrapper`      | Adds `action_mask` to observations        |
| `MaskedActorCriticPolicy`| Learns only over legal actions            |
| `step()` validation      | Ensures robustness against invalid actions |

---

Want me to help you adapt this to your exact `BoopEnv` or Connect4 environment? Just show me what your `step()` and `legal_actions()` look like.

Excellent question — using a `Dict` observation space in Gym (like `spaces.Dict({...})`) gives you **structure and flexibility** that you don’t get with a flat vector or raw array. Here’s a breakdown of when and why you’d want it — especially in board games and RL with structured environments.

---

### **Advantages of `Dict` Observation Space**

#### 1. **Semantic Separation of State Components**
Instead of compressing everything into a single array (which loses meaning), you can split your observation like this:

```python
spaces.Dict({
    "board": spaces.Box(...),        # board state
    "stock": spaces.Box(...),        # player's remaining pieces
    "current_player": spaces.Discrete(2),  # whose turn
    "action_mask": spaces.Box(...),  # valid actions (optional)
})
```

This makes each part of the state **explicit** and easier to:
- **Interpret and debug**
- **Preprocess independently**
- **Feed into neural networks with modular input heads** (e.g., attention over board, MLP for stock)

---

#### 2. **Compatibility with Complex Game Mechanics**
In games like **Boop, Chess, or Stratego**, you often have:
- Hidden information (e.g. fog-of-war)
- Inventories (piece types, cards, actions)
- Turn-based flags

Packing all that into a single array is messy and hard to maintain. A `Dict` allows natural encapsulation.

---

#### 3. **Integration with MultiInputPolicy in SB3**
Stable-Baselines3 supports `Dict` observations with `"MultiInputPolicy"`. This lets your policy network handle different data types in parallel:
- CNN for `board`
- MLP for `stock` and `player turn`

So it's **not just a cleaner API** — it actually enables **richer architectures** for learning.

---

### When to Prefer It

| Use Case | Go with `Dict`? |
|----------|-----------------|
| Just a simple flat board | No |
| You have different types of state info (board, stock, turn, mask...) | **Yes** |
| You want better modularity or input-specific encodings | **Yes** |
| You're using action masks with `sb3-contrib` | **Yes** |

---

### Example: Observation from `BoopEnv`

```python
{
  "board": np.zeros((6, 6, 2)),           # 2 channels: own, opponent
  "stock": np.array([3, 2, 1]),           # pieces left
  "current_player": 0,
  "action_mask": np.array([...])          # added by wrapper
}
```

---

### Summary

| Benefit                      | Why it helps                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Clear structure              | Easier to interpret and debug            |
| Modular input processing     | Custom network heads (board, stock...)   |
| Action masking integration   | Cleanly fits with `sb3-contrib` PPO      |
| Extensible                   | Add more state features later            |
